# Game-Of-Pen-And-Paper
A game about politics. You are now the ruler of a realm. 
Whether the realm you take control of is a failed state, a solidified democracy or a corrupted puppet government, it doesn't matter. 
Your goal is to fight all the odds stacked against, to do what you want with this country. Will it be a democracy ? A monarchy ? 
A military empire ? Will your ambitions work ? Or will your work be fruitless, leading to you being deposed, murdered, toppled, 
or simply not re-elected ?
